[Verse 1]
A multitude had gathered on a hill near Galilee
To hear the words of Jesus and His Miracles to see,
But as the day wore on His disciples came to say
"There's not enough to feed them Lord would you <span style="opacity:.85">(should we)</span> send them away",
But from a little boy's basket of five barley loaves of bread
And with two fish five thousand hungry people would be fed.

[Chorus]
Lord here's my basket, It's not much I know,
But take it and use it, Please don't refuse it
Maybe it will grow.
Although I could keep it I'll give it to you.
So Lord here's my basket you don't have to ask it's the least I can <span style="opacity:.85">(could)</span> do.

[Verse 2]
In each and every life there's a basket filled with <span style="opacity:.85">(full of)</span> goods.
Although it many not be used exactly as it should.
So many throw it all away or keep for themselves
While others they never use it, they just place it on a shelf.
Lord, I know that what you've done for me my basket can't repay.
But maybe with it you could feed some hungry soul along the way.

[Chorus]
Lord Here's my basket, it's not much I know,
But take it and use it, please don't refuse it
Maybe it will grow.
Although I could keep it I'll give it to you.
So Lord here's my basket you don't have to ask it's the least I can do.

[Outro]
So Lord here's my basket you don't have to ask it's the least I can do.
