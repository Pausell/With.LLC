[Verse 1]
When man sinned in the garden
That sin Jehovah could not condone
The blood shed of animals
Could not forever sin atone

[Verse 2]
But the Son had compassion
He said Father I'll be your Lamb
So once again blood was shed
As the soldiers nailed His hands

[Verse 3]
It's been three days since Heaven
Watched their Prince of Glory die
His followers are in mourning
For in the tomb their Saviour lies

[Verse 4]
But at the grave something is happening
As death screams I've lost my hold
Angels rise in anticipation
For the Son is coming home

[Chorus]
And there He comes
And He's got the blood
That He shed on Calvary
And the Father says
Well done my Son
This is the last blood I'll ever need
(Repeat Chorus)
