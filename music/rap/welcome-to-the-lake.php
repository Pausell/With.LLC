Man, nobody preachin' hell anymore
Instead, even some Christians are caught up in materialistic things
Still even in addiction
Not living as a new creation as He called us to be

And still, people in the world are choosing to deny Jesus as the Son of God
Not facing the reality of 'their consequences are gonna put them in hell
if they don't turn away from their sin
and put their trust in Him'.

Listen!
I'm gonna keep my hands clean for my family
it's not by sight by but faith
Yes I can see
God pulled me out of the dirt
Kinda like a sand-flee
When the angels blow the Trumpets
it's gonna sound just like a sand-beam (sound just like a sand beam)

When I hit these streets all these police trynna ban me
No chance? We gonna stop? NO!
Then it lands me in jail,
but it's hell where they really trynna dare me
Too hot down there, there's no air and you can't breathe (and you can't breathe)

So think about it, I'll be servin' 'till the day He calls me (yeah!)
Shootin' scriptures like you spray a tommy (bbbrrraaaahh!)
ACTING ALL TOUGH: are you scared to die?
Not at all,
but when those killers come they're gonna chop your head off and kick it like a soccer ball
If you're sent to hell, He won't hear you when you're prayin'
Body engulfed in fire, flames, I ain't talkin' Super Saiyan (WOAH)

I'm gonna tell the truth: you don't hear me when I say it?
BODY ENGULED IN FIRE: FLAMES; I AIN'T TALKIN' SUPER SAIYAN (NAHH)

Hey, Welcome to the Lake
Where the flames never quench,
And the worm never dies and iniquity leaves a stench
A place that's been forbeared for the prideful one calls it 'Prodem'
Hey, Satan and his angels will wake the day of the fallen.

Hey, Welcome to the Lake, I promise you can't escape
where murderers filled with hate, from those who gave up their faith,
a place that's been forbeared for those who reject the gospel,
for some I know the outcome will be awful.
You sure that's what you want?

You sure that's what you want? x5

Listen,
I do it for the people calling for help.
Messed up, now they're stuck, and they're locked in a cell.
Do it for the Kingdom, you don't 'got to rebel',
You could add all the views, I don't want it all to myself

Is that your Bible that I saw on the shelf?
You fall, we all do so don't crawl in a shell (look it up)
Look at Saul, now I'm Paul, and I'm called to be built 'on the B'.

Got Jesus!
And no longer by myself in these streets (HOT)
Pretty steady in Beat-it
God let me in the ringer,
Throwing jabs at the devil:
he's already been defeated.

I am strong, I am better.
Yes, I do believe in Jesus.
Devil's not on God's level.
Don't believe me? Go and read it.

Staying humble on the right track
No hustlin' I'm done servin' Satan
You gonna get your life back
Turn to Jesus and I promise He could get your life back.

All you gotta do is believe and receive your sight back. (Woah)

Hey, Welcome to the Lake
Where the flames never quench,
and the worm never dies, and iniquity leaves a stench
A place that's been forbeared, for the prideful one calls it 'Prodem'
Hey, Satan and his angels will wake the day of the fallen.

Hey, Welcome to the Lake
I promise you can't escape
Where murderers filled with hate, from those who gave up their faith
A place that's been forbeared, for those who reject the gospel,
for some I know the outcome will be awful!
You sure that's what you want?

If anybody that's listening to this track
And you feel like this song's calling to you right now, feel the Lord's calling to you.
Just say, "Father God, Lord I ain't where I'm supposed to be. I've been living in sin,
I haven't realized I didn't think things through. I didn't realize I was a new creation,
I thought I was just a better person when I came to you. But You said all things are new,
and the past is the past. Lord I'm gonna hold onto my crown of victory, and I ain't giving
it away. I choose today to serve you. In Jesus's name, amen!
