[Verse 1]
Blessed be Your Name
In the land that is plentiful
Where Your streams of abundance flow:
Blessed be Your Name!

Blessed be Your Name,
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness:
Blessed be Your Name

[Chorus]
Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise!
When the darkness closes in Lord,
Still I will say,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
Blessed be Your Name!
Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
Blessed be Your glorious Name!

[Verse 2]
Blessed be Your Name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's "all as it should be"
Blessed be Your Name!

Blessed be Your Name,
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering:
Blessed be Your Name

[Chorus]
Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise!
When the darkness closes in Lord,
Still I will say,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
Blessed be Your Name!
Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
Blessed be Your glorious Name!

[Bridge]
You give and take away,
You give and take away
My heart will choose to say Lord,
Blessed be Your Name!

You give and take away,
You give and take away
My heart will choose to say
Lord, blessed be Your Name!

[Verse 4]
Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
Blessed be Your Name!
Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
Blessed be Your glorious Name!

Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
Blessed be Your Name!
Blessed be the Name of the Lord:
Blessed be Your glorious Name!
