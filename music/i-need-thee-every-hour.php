[Verse 1]
I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford

[Chorus]
I need Thee, O I need Thee,
Every hour I need Thee!
O bless me now, my Savior,
I come to Thee!

[Verse 2]
I need Thee every hour,
Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

[Chorus]
I need Thee, O I need Thee,
Every hour I need Thee!
O bless me now, my Savior,
I come to Thee!

[Verse 3]
I need Thee every hour,
In joy, or pain;
Come quickly and abide
Or life is vain.

[Chorus]
I need Thee, O I need Thee,
Every hour I need Thee!
O bless me now, my Savior,
I come to Thee!

[Verse 4]
I need Thee every hour,
Teach me Thy will;
Thy promises so rich
In me fulfill.

[Chorus]
I need Thee, O I need Thee,
Every hour I need Thee!
O bless me now, my Savior,
I come to Thee!

[Verse 5]
I need Thee every hour,
Most Holy One,
O make me Thine indeed,
Thou Blessed Son!

[Chorus]
I need Thee, O I need Thee,
Every hour I need Thee!
O bless me now, my Savior,
I come to Thee!
