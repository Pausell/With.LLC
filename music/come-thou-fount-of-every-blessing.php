[Verse 1]
Come Thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

[Verse 2]
Here I raise my Ebenezer
Here by Thy great help I've come
And I hope by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
Here to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood
(Precious blood)

[Verse 3]
Oh, that day when freed from sinning
I shall see Thy lovely face
Clothe it then in blood washed linen
How I'll sing Thy sovereign grace
Come my Lord, no longer tarry
Take my ransom soul away
Send Thine angels now to carry
Me to realms of endless days

[Verse 4]
Oh, to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constraint to be
Let Thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, oh take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

[Outro]
Here's my heart, oh, take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above
